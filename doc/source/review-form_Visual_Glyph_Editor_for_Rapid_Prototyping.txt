REVIEW FORM for the paper Visual Glyph Editor for Rapid Prototyping
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
(+) Summary of the paper's contribution
Please outline briefly the main contribution of this submission.

The amount of data is growing with every elapsed time period. Therefore the need for efficient data analysis and representation of large amounts of data is growing to be more important than ever.
The thesis deals with the analysis of techniques to analyze large multivariate data sets. One and probably the most important technique is the usage of graphical icons that depict these data sets, so called glyphs. This is a so called icon-based technique. Important when using glyphs is the way the data is mapped to the visual features of the glyph. The techniques of multivariate visualization is divided into the groups, geometric projection techniques, scatterplot matrix, pixel-oriented techniques, recursive pattern, spiral and axe techniques, hierarchical techniques, hierarchical axis technique and dimensional stacking. Also important is the time-oriented aspect, because lots of data that is processed nowadays is related to time. At last different frameworks and tools for data visualization are reviewed.
Summarized it is fact that glyphs are very effective, because they take advantage of the human perception abilities. Hence the importance of glyphs there are still no guidelines for their designing process. Because of the high degree of difficulty when designing them, there are several editors to support this process, but still no one has a high enough usability to make the usage convenient for unexperienced users.
No editor offers the functionality to design the time component in a special way, but as usual quantitative parameter.
Important to state out in the beginning is the difference of multidimensional and multivariate data. Whereas multidimensional data includes several independent dimensions, multivariate data refers to the dimensionality of dependent variables.

(+) Utility, Importance (relevance in general):
Does the paper provide a relevant, needed contribution? Is there a potential that this paper could become an important reference for future work? Is the paper relevant for important applications?
3 - Addresses clear need
2 - Possibly useful
1 - Case for utility not compelling

2 – Possibly useful.
The paper contains a very detailed overview of the different existing techniques including their pros and cons. It also shows up the existing frameworks and tools to use these techniques in practice. Because there are no existing tools with high usability for unexpirienced users, the paper could be useful for persons who are planning to implement a new and more practicable tool.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
(+) Soundness (technical soundness, soundness of approach):
Is paper technically sound (when this question is applicable)? Is the chosen approach sound/correct? Is the presented research methodology sound?
3 - Approach is (technically) correct and well justified
2 - Some concerns on correctness, some choices questionable
1 - Fundamentally unsound (technical) approach

3 – Approach is (technically) correct and well justified.
The paper sounds all together correct and professional.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
(+) Reproducability:
3 - Everything critical is discussed
2 - Many issues discussed, but some important details left out
1 - Work cannot be replicated because too many critical aspects remain murky

3 – Everything critical is discussed.
As far as I can evaluate, the important approaches are discussed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
(+) Presentation Quality:
5 - Excellent: exposition is clear and writing flows well

3 - Fair: some structural changes or some wordsmithing needed
2 - Poor: major structural changes or extensive wordsmithing needed
1 - Unpublishable: too difficult to understand

5 – Excellent: exposition is clear and writing flows well.

In my opinion the papers is very professional. It contains all the relevant information of the field well explained with all the advantages and disadvantages. It could contain a direct comparison of all the included and explained approaches. There is very much literature included and citied, which in my opinion is also a sign that the paper covers all relevant aspects. Nice style and very well structure -> very clear. Therefore it can be reproduced by another student easily.
