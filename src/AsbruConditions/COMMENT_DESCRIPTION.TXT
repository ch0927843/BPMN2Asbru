description: in this package all implemented classes are corresponding to the different elements defined
in the asgard/asbru dtd

at the current implementation not all child-elements and/or attributes are used;
for example many elements and the corresponding classes of this package can include comments,
but the implemented conditions of the package "Conditions" only offer comments for the basic "asbru-conditions",
which are:
- CombinedCondition
- ComparisonCondition
- ContainsCondition
- IteratorEndCondition
- IteratorStartCondition
- NotCondition
- OccuranceCondition
- RangeCondition
- VariableKnownCondition
- VariableUnknownCondition

note:
as a result of java not offering multiple inheritance and due to the fact that many classes need a base class for offering "asbru comments",
i had to use interfaces to create some inheritance structures, even if true inheritance would have been best practice in these cases.
