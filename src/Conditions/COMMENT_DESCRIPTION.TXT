description: this package includes (container-)classes to represent "real life conditions";
these conditions are filtered of clinical practice guidelines (CPG)

the different classes offer different interfaces to represent different conditions, such as comparison,
contains, ranges,...

the information stored in objects of these classes are used to be transfered into the classes of the
package "AsbruConditions", which in turn represent the elements defined by the Asgard/Asbru

note: only the most outer condition classes offer the usage of comments at the moment, these are:
- CombinedCondition: combination of 2 or more conditions
- ComparisonCondition: conditions containing a comparison
- ContainsCondition: represents a condition that models an "in" -> if one variable (or value) is contained in a list of variables (or values)
- IteratorEndCondition
- IteratorStartCondition
- NotCondition: negation of any kind of condition
- OccuranceCondition
- RangeCondition: models if a value is in between two other values
- VariableKnownCondition
- VariableUnknownCondition
